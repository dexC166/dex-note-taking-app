/**
 * @fileoverview Vite configuration for the Dex Note Taking App frontend.
 *
 * This configuration file defines how Vite builds and serves the React frontend
 * application. Vite is a modern build tool that provides fast development server
 * with hot module replacement and optimized production builds. The configuration
 * is minimal but leverages Vite's intelligent defaults for React applications.
 *
 * Key Features:
 * - Fast development server with hot module replacement
 * - Optimized production builds with code splitting
 * - ES module support for modern JavaScript features
 * - JSX compilation and React component support
 * - Asset optimization and bundling
 * - Integration with Tailwind CSS and PostCSS

/**
 * Vite configuration object for the React frontend application.
 *
 * This configuration uses Vite's defineConfig function which provides
 * TypeScript support and intelligent defaults for React applications.
 * The configuration is intentionally minimal, leveraging Vite's
 * built-in optimizations and the React plugin's comprehensive features.
 *
 * **Why this approach?**
 * - **Minimal configuration**: Vite's defaults are well-optimized for React
 * - **Fast development**: Hot module replacement and instant server start
 * - **Production optimization**: Automatic code splitting and asset optimization
 * - **Modern tooling**: ES modules, TypeScript support, and modern JavaScript features
 * - **Plugin ecosystem**: React plugin handles JSX, HMR, and React-specific optimizations
 *
 * **Build Process:**
 * - Development: `npm run dev` starts the Vite dev server with HMR
 * - Production: `npm run build` creates optimized static files in `dist/`
 * - Preview: `npm run preview` serves the production build locally
 *
 * **Integration with Other Tools:**
 * - Tailwind CSS: Processed through PostCSS during build
 * - ESLint: Runs during development and build process
 * - Vercel: Deploys the `dist/` folder as static files
 * - React Router: Handles client-side routing in production
