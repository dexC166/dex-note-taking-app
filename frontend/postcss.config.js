/**
 * @fileoverview PostCSS configuration for the Dex Note Taking App frontend.
 *
 * This configuration file defines how PostCSS processes CSS during the build
 * process. PostCSS acts as a CSS preprocessor that transforms Tailwind CSS
 * directives into actual CSS and adds vendor prefixes for cross-browser
 * compatibility. It integrates seamlessly with Vite to provide fast CSS
 * processing during development and optimized output for production.
 *
 * Key Features:
 * - Tailwind CSS processing and utility class generation
 * - Autoprefixer for cross-browser compatibility
 * - Vite integration for fast development and production builds
 * - CSS purging and optimization for smaller bundle sizes
 * - Hot module replacement for instant style updates

/**
 * PostCSS configuration object for CSS processing pipeline.
 *
 * This configuration defines the PostCSS plugins that process CSS files
 * during the build process. PostCSS acts as a CSS preprocessor that
 * transforms modern CSS syntax and Tailwind directives into browser-compatible
 * CSS with proper vendor prefixes and optimizations.
 *
 * Why this approach?
 * - Tailwind processing: Converts utility classes and directives to CSS
 * - Autoprefixer: Ensures cross-browser compatibility with vendor prefixes
 * - Vite integration: Seamless integration with the Vite build system
 * - Performance: Fast CSS processing during development and production
 * - Optimization: Automatic CSS purging and minification for production
 *
 * CSS Processing Pipeline:
 * 1. Tailwind CSS: Processes @tailwind directives and utility classes
 * 2. Autoprefixer: Adds vendor prefixes for cross-browser compatibility
 * 3. Vite: Handles CSS bundling and optimization
 * 4. Output: Generates optimized CSS for development and production

  /**
   * PostCSS plugins configuration for CSS processing.
   *
   * This object defines the plugins that PostCSS will use to process CSS files.
   * The plugins are executed in order, with each plugin transforming the CSS
   * before passing it to the next plugin in the pipeline.
   *
   * Why these plugins?
   * - tailwindcss: Essential for processing Tailwind CSS directives and utilities
   * - autoprefixer: Critical for cross-browser compatibility and modern CSS features
   * - Plugin order: Tailwind processes first, then autoprefixer adds vendor prefixes
   * - Minimal config: Uses default settings for both plugins for simplicity

     * Tailwind CSS plugin for processing utility classes and directives.
     *
     * This plugin processes Tailwind CSS directives (@tailwind base, @tailwind
     * components, @tailwind utilities) and utility classes used throughout the
     * application. It generates the actual CSS based on the Tailwind configuration
     * and the classes found in the source files.
     *
     * What it does:
     * - Processes @tailwind directives in CSS files
     * - Generates CSS for utility classes used in HTML/JSX
     * - Applies Tailwind configuration (theme, plugins, etc.)
     * - Purges unused styles for optimal bundle size
     * - Integrates with DaisyUI component classes
     *
     * Why empty config?
     * - Uses tailwind.config.js for all configuration
     * - Default settings work well for most use cases
     * - Keeps configuration centralized in one place
     * - Simplifies maintenance and updates

     * Autoprefixer plugin for cross-browser compatibility.
     *
     * This plugin automatically adds vendor prefixes to CSS properties that
     * require them for cross-browser compatibility. It uses data from Can I Use
     * to determine which prefixes are needed for different browser versions.
     *
     * What it does:
     * - Adds vendor prefixes (webkit-, moz-, ms-, etc.) to CSS properties
     * - Uses Can I Use data to determine required prefixes
     * - Handles modern CSS features like flexbox, grid, and custom properties
     * - Ensures consistent rendering across different browsers
     * - Optimizes prefix usage to avoid unnecessary prefixes
     *
     * Why empty config?
     * - Default settings work well for modern browsers
     * - Automatically detects which prefixes are needed
     * - Uses sensible defaults for browser support
     * - Reduces configuration complexity
